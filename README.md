# Performance Test Data Analysis with GPT-2

## Overview

This project demonstrates how performance testing data can be utilized to train a machine learning model and analyze performance test results. Using a small GPT-2 model, the trained model is capable of interpreting performance test data and categorizing system performance based on the test results.

Once the model has been trained with sufficient data, it can be deployed in a production environment to monitor system performance and trigger alerts or analysis based on the predictions generated by the model.

## Project Description

In modern systems, performance testing is essential for identifying bottlenecks and ensuring that systems operate efficiently under various loads. This project aims to automate the analysis of performance testing results using machine learning models.

### Key Features:
- **Training with Performance Test Data:** A small GPT-2 model is trained using labeled performance test data (e.g., CPU, Memory, Disk usage) to predict system performance labels like "LowLoad", "MediumLoad", and "HighLoad".
- **Automated Labeling:** The model is trained to recognize patterns in the data and assign appropriate labels based on system performance metrics.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Once trained, the model can be deployed to monitor real-time production systems by evaluating performance test results.

### Use Case:

- **Training:** Collect performance data from different systems under various loads. Label the data (e.g., "LowLoad", "HighLoad"), and use it to train the model.
- **Prediction:** The trained model can be used to predict system performance in real time, categorizing performance data for operational monitoring.

## How It Works

### 1. **Data Generation**

The training data consists of performance metrics such as:

- **CPU Load**
- **Memory Usage**
- **Disk Usage**

Example training data:
CPU Load: 30%, Memory: 4GB, Disk: 10% -> Label: LowLoad CPU Load: 90%, Memory: 1GB, Disk: 95% -> Label: HighLoad


This data is used to train the model to predict the system's performance category (Low, Medium, High).

### 2. **Model Training**

The model used is **DistilGPT-2**, a smaller and more efficient version of GPT-2, fine-tuned on the labeled data. The training process involves:

- Loading the data and pre-processing it.
- Fine-tuning the model to recognize patterns in the input data and learn how to categorize the performance labels.
- Saving the trained model for later use in production.

### 3. **Real-Time Monitoring and Inference**

Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict system performance based on live data, providing real-time feedback on system health and triggering alerts when performance exceeds thresholds (e.g., "HighLoad").

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries**:
  - `transformers` (Hugging Face Transformers library)
  - `torch` (PyTorch)
  - `pandas` (for data manipulation)
  - `wandb` (for logging and visualization â€” optional)

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install transformers torch pandas wandb
